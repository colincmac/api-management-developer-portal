# Async-API Widget

The Async-API widget is a powerful tool that allows you to integrate asynchronous API documentation into your developer portal. With this widget, you can easily display and interact with Async-API specifications, making it easier for developers to understand and consume your APIs.

## Features

- Embed the Async API React component in your developer portal

## Local Testing

You can run the Widget locally by using Vite:
1. Clone the repository
2. Rename [.env.example](./.env.example) to .env and update the variables
3. *Optionally* update the deploy.js file with the appropriate values
4. Navigate to the current folder in a terminal
5. Run `npm run host`

The application should start locally and open the APIM Dev Portal in your browser. The functionality of the AsyncAPI plugin will be proxied to your locally running application.
